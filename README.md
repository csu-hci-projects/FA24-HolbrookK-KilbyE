Sources:

  In addition to class material, the textbook, and the lab videos, we each used other sources to help us design
  the FPS game. Neither of us used any AI. Here are the links to the additional videos we used.

Contributions:

  We were each in charge of making one unique level with the required hazards, targets, health, and limited ammo. 
  Elizabeth made the second level and Katie made the third level. Then, we worked together to make the first menu level
  and loaded the levels in order. Finally, we recorded and edited the two videos together as well. The workload was fair and
  each member contributed an equal amount.

  The game:
  
    Level 1
      This level is a menu scene where the player may begin the game by clicking "start." After clicking start, the second 
      level will be automatically loaded. There is also an option for the player to exit the game by clicking the "quit" 
      button.
      
    Level 2
      This level takes place in a castle courtyard where the player must destroy all three targets to move to the next level. Each
      target has a health bar that starts at 100. After each hit, the target health decreases by 25. Once at zero, the target is 
      destroyed. However, the player only has five ammunition projectiles. Since ammo is limmited to five, ammo pickups are available which 
      each give the player two more projectiles. Similarly, health pickups are available and will increase the player's health by 10. The 
      player must avoid the water, as it will damage the player's health. If the player's health goes to zero, the level will automatically
      restart. The targets, ammo pickups, and health pickups are all strategiucally placed in areas where the player may easily touch the water.
      Once the player has successfully destroyed all three targets, the third level will automatically load.
